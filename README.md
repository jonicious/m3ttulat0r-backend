==========
We love Mett. At our job, we have a tradition called “Mettwoch”. Every wednesday, one brings Mett. Since the number of participants varies from time to time, the challenge is to know how much Mett and how many buns we need. Entering m3ttulat0r.

m3ttulat0r solves all these problems. Users can enter the number of halves of mett buns they want to eat this wednesday. m3ttulat0r automatically calculates the necessary amount of Mett and buns.

Every week another person brings Mett, so this person needs to get notified about how much Mett and how many buns he has to bring. We solve that by sending an email the day before the Mett day.

## Future Ideas

- If user orders Mett, generate an iCal file
- Statistics/analytics
- Calculation of costs
- Review your last Mett
